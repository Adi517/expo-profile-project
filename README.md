# glitch.house - Take Home Assignment

**Objective**: Implement a smooth shared transition between **2 screens** as shown below.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31c2c3a0-3f72-4601-8fd6-8d4f2fab1896

- Implement both screens: **Main Page** & **Detail Page** *(refer to the Figma link for full details).*
- When the user taps or clicks on the card, it should animate seamlessly from its position on the Main Screen to its new layout on the Detail Screen using a shared element transition *(as shown in the video).*
