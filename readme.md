# glitch.house - take home assignment

below is a screen recording of a figma prototype where a student selects tracks in our app. the goal is to replicate the shared element transition shown in the video as smoothly as possible using react native and expo.

### **requirements:**

- implement **both screens**: **main page** & **detail page** *(refer to the figma link for full details).*  
- when the user taps on the card, it should animate seamlessly from its position on the main screen to its new layout on the detail screen using a **shared element transition** *(as shown in the video).*  
- ensure the animation between the two screens is **smooth** â€“ follow the video as a guide for animation timing and fluidity (check react-native-reanimated).  
- the user interface must **match the figma designs accurately**.


### **instructions:**

1. **fork the repository**:
