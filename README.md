# glitch.house - Take-Home Assignment

Below is a screen recording of a Figma prototype where a student selects tracks in our app. The goal is to replicate the shared element transition shown in the video as smoothly as possible using React Native and Expo.

### **Task Requirements:**

- Implement **both screens**: **Main Page** & **Detail Page** *(refer to the Figma link for full details).*
- When the user taps or clicks on the card, it should animate seamlessly from its position on the Main Screen to its new layout on the Detail Screen using a **shared element transition** *(as shown in the video).*
- Ensure the animation between the two screens is **smooth** â€“ follow the video as a guide for animation timing and fluidity.
- The user interface must **match the Figma designs accurately**.
